## Running the app

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Libraries used
- **axios**: for data fetching. Could be fetch api, but axios gives more flexibility

## Notes
- app created by `create-react-app`
- `.env` file added for allowing app to use absolute paths, instead of relative (by adding `NODE_PATH=./` line to it)
